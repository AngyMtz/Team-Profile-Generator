## User Story

I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Acceptance Criteria

md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:

WHAT I WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH

For this project I was able to complete the Acceptance Criteria.  All of the links work and it accepts input from the user and then displays the information for the Manager, Engineer or the Intern in an html document that is generated by the program and stored in the dist folder.  This was a challenging assignment, but with some work and a lot of research I was able to complete the task.
